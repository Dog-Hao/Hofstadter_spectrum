This project provides code that diagonalizes the continuum model under magentic field, including the calculation of Hofstadter bands and Chern numbers. 
The lattice can be arbitrary by providing a1=[a1x>0, a1y] (a2=[0, 1] is fixed).
The Bloch Landau levels (LL) are chosen as the basis, and the LL cutoff (NLL) can be as huge as >500.
