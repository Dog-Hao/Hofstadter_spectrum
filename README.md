(a) This project provides code that diagonalizes the continuum model under magentic field, including the calculation of Hofstadter bands and Chern numbers. The theory is provided in the two notes 'Note_LL_formulation.pdf' and 'Note_Hofstadter.pdf'

(b) The lattice can be arbitrary by providing a1=[a1x>0, a1y] (a2=[0, 1] is fixed).

(c) The Bloch Landau levels are chosen as the basis, whose cutoff (NLL) can be as huge as >500.
